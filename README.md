### Task:
I was responsible for developing these dashboards, utilizing SQL for data assurance and Power BI for visualization. The key metrics included:

- Total Loan Applications: 38,600
- Total Funded Amount: $435.8 million
- Total Amount Received: $473.1 million
- Average Interest Rate: 12%
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): 13.3%

### Action:
##### Dashboard 1: Focused on tracking these KPIs with interactive visuals and SQL-validated data.
##### Dashboard 2: Featured advanced charts:
- Line Chart: Monthly trends by issue date.
- Donut Chart: Loan term distribution.
- Bar Charts: Employee length and loan purpose breakdowns.
- Tree Map: Home ownership impact.

- SQL Code Link: https://github.com/SahajV1/Bank-Loan-Dashboard/blob/main/SQL%20Query.sql
